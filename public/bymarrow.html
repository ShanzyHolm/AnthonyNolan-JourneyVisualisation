          overnight before you head to the hospital the next day. Our treat!

          morning, you will get a general anesthetic.

          <u>Step 3</u>: Now it's time for a short procedure; it should take
          about 30 minutes. It's not hard, you just lie on your side and bone
          marrow is removed from your pelvic bone using a needle and syringe. At
          the end of the procedure, you will have 2 plasters covering the places
          the bone marrow was taken from and thats it.

          <u>MYTH</u>: Donating bone marrow is a <u>really</u> painful process.
        </h5>
        <h5>
          <u>FACT</u>: Most donors say that its similar to how you feel after an
          intense workout at the gym.
        </h5>

        <h3>
          <u>Step 4</u>: When you wake up, you may feel bruised from the
          needles. Your friend arrives. You will have to spend that day and
          night recovering from the anesthetic, before heading home the next
          day.
