      The recipients who receive your stem cells, badly need them. You will have
      given someone with blood cancer, the gift of life. Your stem cells can
      help kickstart their system into action and help them to fight and recover
      and continue to live their life. You have the power to save a life! You
      are awesome! You are a hero!
