        <h3>
          <u>Step 1</u>: We help to stimulate your body to increase stem cell
          production through 4 days of daily injections. You might be a little
          achy during this process but don't worry this is normal and we try to
          make you as comfortable as possible, even having the nurse visit you
          to give you the injections.

          <u>Step 2</u>: Next, we send you and your chosen companion to a hotel
          overnight before you head to the hospital the next day. Our treat!

        <h3>
          <u>Step 3</u>: Today's the Day! You are becoming a Hero! All you have
          to do is sit for 4 or 5 hours, reading, watching television, or
          chatting to your friend while you are hooked up to a machine. The
          machine does all the work; taking blood from one arm, filtering it to
          remove the stem cells and then returning the filtered blood to your
          other arm.

        <h3>
          <u>Step 4</u>: If at the end of the 4 or 5 hours, we have collected
          enough stem cells then you can head home; however, if we haven't been
          able to collect enough, then we give you another injection and get you
          and your companion back the next day to do it again.
