          Step 1: We help to stimulate your body to increase stem cell
          production through 4 days of daily injections. You might be a little
          achy during this process but don't worry this is normal and we try to
          make you as comfortable as possible, even having the nurse visit you
          to give you the injections.
        </h3>

      <div class="column">
        <h3>
          Step 2: Next, we send you and your chosen companion to a hotel
          overnight before you head to the hospital the next day. Our treat!

      <div class="column">
        <h3>
          Step 3: Today's the Day! You are becoming a Hero! All you have to do
          is sit for 4 or 5 hours, reading, watching television, or chatting to
          your friend while you are hooked up to a machine. The machine does all
          the work; taking blood from one arm, filtering it to remove the stem
          cells and then returning the filtered blood to your other arm.
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div class="column">
        <h3>
          Step 4: If at the end of the 4 or 5 hours, we have collected enough
          stem cells then you can head home; however, if we haven't been able to
          collect enough, then we give you another injection and get you and
          your companion back the next day to do it again.
